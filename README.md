# Pima Indians Diabetes Prediction
This is my first official github repo

The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
The technology that was used here is Jupyter Notebook. Python is used for coding with Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib dan Seaborn for visualization. I used Random Forest Machine Learning model for modelling the prediction
